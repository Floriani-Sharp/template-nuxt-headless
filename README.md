# Nuxt 3 Vue.js template with Tailwind CSS, FontAwesome, Jest and Headless UI (Headless Fork)

This Git project serves as a template for Nuxt 3 in conjunction with Vue.js. It uses the CSS library Tailwind CSS for the simple design of user interfaces, FontAwesome for the integration of symbols and already contains the Jest configuration for tests. Additionally, Headless UI was integrated to provide accessible and customizable components for modern web development.

This project is a fork of the original “template-nuxt” project, which can be found at: [link to original project](https://github.com/Floriani-Sharp/template-nuxt.git)
